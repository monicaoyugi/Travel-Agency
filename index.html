    <p class="tropical"> <strong>Trails</strong> a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism related services to the general public
        on behalf of suppliers. Travel agencies can provide outdoor recreation activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise
        lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, package tours, insurance, guide books, public transport timetables,
        car rentals, and bureau de change services. Travel agencies can also serve as general sales agents for airlines
        that do not have offices in a specific region. A travel agency's main function is to act as an agent, selling
        travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. They do not keep inventory in hand, unless they have
        pre-booked hotel rooms and/or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or
        a group event.</p>
